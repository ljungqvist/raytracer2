	Raytracing is a method for generating images of three dimensional worlds. Artificial "rays" are shot from a camera (virtual eyepoint) trough every pixel of an image, and if the ray hits an object, the pixel's color is calculated from scene parameters at that intersection point. Any mathematical surface that can be intersected by a line can be rendered using raytracing.
	
	We have been focusing on rendering a realistic static image in this project. Performance has naturally been taken into account, but we have tried not to compromise the finale image.
