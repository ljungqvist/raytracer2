%	In this chapter you must tell what is done in different way that was originally planned and why.

%	Do you think your plan was good enough, super, or should you have planned your program better?

The original plan turned out to be quite good and no mayor changes where needed. There were naturally quite a bit of stuffing added in the implementations stage, but the main idea stayed the same. Our clear original plan helped us to understand each other and what we wanted from the project and made it easier to work towards a common goal.
